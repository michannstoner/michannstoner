### Hi there, so happy you stopped by! 👋🏼

My name is Michann Stoner and I am a software engineer, currently enrolled at Turing School of Software and Design.
Combined with my past experience as a client-focused account manager, my goal is to create and collaborate on applications that foster a seamless user experience and leave a positive impact.
