### Hi there, so happy you stopped by! 👋🏼

My name is Michann Stoner and I am a software engineer, currently enrolled at Turing School of Software and Design.
Combined with my past experience as a client-focused account manager, my goal is to create and collaborate on applications that foster a seamless user experience and leave a positive impact.

When I'm not learning how to code, I enjoy: 

- Painting & textile art 
- Cooking 
- Taking care of my plants
- Reading
- The good ol outdoors
